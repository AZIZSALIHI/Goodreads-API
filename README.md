This was a small task I had been requested to do. The task was to build an output interface while working with a 3rd-party API (Goodreads) using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

Instructions: 
Your application should be composed of a simple search box that upon enter or click of the "Search" button, triggers a search using a (provided) REST endpoint which proxies Goodreads' public APIs, transforms it into JSON, and adds CORS headers for client-side use. The results of the API call should be displayed in your app. 

How to use:

1) Enter an Author, Title or ISBN
2) Hit "Search" or Enter

A table should be populated with the requested book data.
